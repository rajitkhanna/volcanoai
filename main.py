Sample query: 

Hi my name is Barbara Barr, and I order a lot of components from Argon Medical 
Devices and I want to know how much I need to order from them this week across 
all parts that I am responsible for in order to my products going below safety 
stock. (Also, how much have I already ordered? Make sure itâ€™s part of my 
calculations).
